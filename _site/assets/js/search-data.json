    "content": "Privacy is a significant concern in modern society. Individuals share personal information with many different organizations - healthcare, financial and educational institutions, the census bureau, web services providers and online social networks - often in electronic form. Privacy violations occur when such personal information is inappropriately collected, shared or used. We will study privacy in a few settings where rigorous definitions and enforcement mechanisms are being developed. The primary focus of this course is differential privacy, a framework of designing data analysis algorithms with strong, meaningful, and mathematically provable privacy guarantees. We will survey a set of algorithmic tools that allow us to privately perform a wide range of statistical analyses and machine learning tasks. Of course, privacy does not come for free, and we will also study some of the fundamental limitations imposed by the requirement of differential privacy. We will also cover other topics related to privacy, including fairness and cryptography. ",

Dimensions of diversity include race, age, national origin, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, intellectual and physical ability, sexual orientation, faith and non-faith perspectives, socio-economic class, political ideology, education, primary language, family status, military experience, cognitive style, and communication style. We are intentional in our aim to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity, based on these dimensions and any other visible and invisible differences not captured in this list. Indeed, in this class you will learn to approach technology design from an empathetic, human-centered perspective that directly examines and challenges bias and inequality. Your suggestions for ensuring that the class lives up to these values are encouraged and welcomed. In addition, if at any time you experience or witness anything in this class that challenges inclusion, is insensitive or othering, or reinforces biases or stereotypes, please report those experiences (responses can be anonymous).
