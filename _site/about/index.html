Individuals share personal information with many different organizations - healthcare, financial and educational institutions, the census bureau, web services providers and online social networks - often in electronic form. Privacy violations occur when such personal information is inappropriately collected, shared or used. We will study privacy in a few settings where rigorous definitions and enforcement mechanisms are being developed. The primary focus of this course is <strong>differential privacy</strong>, a framework of designing data analysis algorithms with strong, meaningful, and mathematically provable privacy guarantees. We will survey a set of algorithmic tools that allow us to privately perform a wide range of statistical analyses and machine learning tasks. Of course, privacy does not come for free, and we will also study some of the fundamental limitations imposed by the requirement of differential privacy.</p><p>We will also cover other topics related to privacy, including fairness and cryptography.</p><h2 id="logistics"> <a href="#logistics" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="logistics"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Logistics</h2><ul><li><strong>Course</strong>: Foundations of Privacy, Fall 2022<li><strong>Lecture Time</strong>: Fall 2021, 11:50AM–1:10PM EST, Mon &amp; Weds<li><strong>Zoom Link</strong>: See Canvas</ul><h2 id="prerequisites"> <a href="#prerequisites" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="prerequisites"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Prerequisites</h2><p>This is a theory-oriented course, intended for graduate students and advanced undergraduates. The (informal) prerequisite is familiarity with probability, linear algebra, and introductory algorithms. Prior coursework in machine learning, algorithms, and probability will be helpful.</p><h2 id="textbooks"> <a href="#textbooks" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="textbooks"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Textbooks</h2><p>There is no need buy any textbook for this course. We will provide lecture notes in this course. In addition, we will frequently use the book <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf">The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy</a> by <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/dwork/">Cynthia Dwork</a> and <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/">Aaron Roth</a> and <a href="https://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/files/privacytools/files/complexityprivacy_1.pdf">The Complexity of Differential Privacy</a> by <a href="https://salil.seas.harvard.edu/">Salil Vadhan</a>.</p><h2 id="accommodations-for-students-with-disabilities"> <a href="#accommodations-for-students-with-disabilities" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="accommodations-for-students-with-disabilities"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</h2><p>If you have a disability and are registered with the Office of Disability Resources, we encourage you to use their online system to notify us of your accommodations and discuss your needs with us as early in the semester as possible. We will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, we encourage you to contact them at <a href="access@andrew.cmu.edu">access@andrew.cmu.edu</a>.</p><h2 id="diversity-statement"> <a href="#diversity-statement" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="diversity-statement"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Diversity Statement</h2><p>It is our goal that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives are well served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. Dimensions of diversity include race, age, national origin, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, intellectual and physical ability, sexual orientation, faith and non-faith perspectives, socio-economic class, political ideology, education, primary language, family status, military experience, cognitive style, and communication style. We are intentional in our aim to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity, based on these dimensions and any other visible and invisible differences not captured in this list. Indeed, in this class you will learn to approach technology design from an empathetic, human-centered perspective that directly examines and challenges bias and inequality. Your suggestions for ensuring that the class lives up to these values are encouraged and welcomed. In addition, if at any time you experience or witness anything in this class that challenges inclusion, is insensitive or othering, or reinforces biases or stereotypes, please report those experiences (responses can be anonymous).</p><h2 id="communication"> <a href="#communication" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="communication"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Communication</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Canvas</strong>: We will be using Canvas for all assignments and grades. Please also post all questions on Canvas as discussions instead of sending emails.</p><li><p><strong>Email</strong>: If you email your instructors, you might want to include the substring “[FoundPriv Course]” to begin a meaningful subject line and have tried to resolve the issue appropriately otherwise. For example, you should post questions about course material and homework assignments on Canvas first, and then use emails only after an appropriate amount of time has passed without a response. Please use your CMU email account.</p></ul><h2 id="grading"> <a href="#grading" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="grading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Grading</h2><div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Percentage<th>Activity<tbody><tr><td>10%<td>In-class Activity Participation<tr><td>60%<td>Assignment 1-4, 15% each<tr><td>15%<td>Midterm<tr><td>15%<td>Final exam</table></div><h2 id="when-work-is-due"> <a href="#when-work-is-due" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="when-work-is-due"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> When Work is Due</h2><ul><li>Assignments are due on Sundays at 11:59pm.</ul><h2 id="late-assignments"> <a href="#late-assignments" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="late-assignments"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Late Assignments</h2><p>We realize that things happen, and that you might sometimes not be able to turn in your assignments. To accommodate this, you will each receive <strong>5 free late days</strong>.</p><p>Beyond those days, you receive a 5% penalty for each day late. You are welcome to budget late days as you like, for instance 3 free days late for one assignment, 2 for another, or all 5 for one.</p><h2 id="special-accommodations"> <a href="#special-accommodations" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="special-accommodations"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Special Accommodations</h2><p>If you have a disability and have an accommodation letter from the Disability Resources office, we encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with us as early in the semester as possible. We will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate.

Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.</p><p>All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is almost always helpful.</p><p>If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/">http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/</a>. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.</p><p>If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of self-harm, call someone immediately, day or night:</p><p>CaPS: 412-268-2922</p><p>Re:solve Crisis Network: 888-796-8226</p></div></div><div class="search-overlay"></div></div>
