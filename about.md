## Overview

Privacy is a significant concern in modern society. Individuals share
personal information with many different organizations - healthcare,
financial and educational institutions, the census bureau, web
services providers and online social networks - often in electronic
form. Privacy violations occur when such personal information is
inappropriately collected, shared or used. We will study privacy in a
few settings where rigorous definitions and enforcement mechanisms are
being developed. The primary focus of this course is **differential
privacy**, a framework of designing data analysis algorithms with
strong, meaningful, and mathematically provable privacy guarantees. We
will survey a set of algorithmic tools that allow us to privately
perform a wide range of statistical analyses and machine learning
tasks. Of course, privacy does not come for free, and we will also
study some of the fundamental limitations imposed by the requirement
of differential privacy. 

We will also cover other topics related to privacy, including fairness
and cryptography.

## Logistics
- **Course**: Foundations of Privacy, Fall 2025
- **Lecture Time**: Fall 2025, 12:30PM--1:50PM EST, Mon & Weds
- **Recitation**: Fall 2025, 1:00PM--1:50PM EST, Friday
- **Location**: GHC 4215 (Pittsburgh campus)

## Prerequisites
This is a theory-oriented course, intended for graduate students and
advanced undergraduates. The (informal) prerequisite is familiarity
with probability, linear algebra, and introductory algorithms. Prior
coursework in machine learning, algorithms, and probability will be
helpful.

## Textbooks
There is no need buy any textbook for this course. We will provide
lecture notes in this course. In addition, we will frequently use the
book [The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential
Privacy](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf) by
[Cynthia
Dwork](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/dwork/) and
[Aaron Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/) and [The Complexity
of Differential
Privacy](https://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/files/privacytools/files/complexityprivacy_1.pdf)
by [Salil Vadhan](https://salil.seas.harvard.edu/).





## Communication

- **Canvas**: We will be using Canvas for all assignments and grades.
Please also post all questions on Canvas as discussions instead of
sending emails.

-  **Email**: If you email your instructors, you might want to include
  the substring "[FoundPriv Course]" to begin a meaningful subject
  line and have tried to resolve the issue appropriately
  otherwise. For example, you should post questions about course
  material and homework assignments on Canvas first, and then use
  emails only after an appropriate amount of time has passed without a
  response. Please use your CMU email account.

## Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
If you have a disability and are registered with the Office of
Disability Resources, we encourage you to use their online system to
notify us of your accommodations and discuss your needs with us as
early in the semester as possible. We will work with you to ensure
that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that
you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but
are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, we
encourage you to contact them at
[access@andrew.cmu.edu](access@andrew.cmu.edu).

## Diversity Statement
It is our goal that students from all diverse backgrounds and
perspectives are well served by this course, that studentsâ€™ learning
needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity
that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength,
and benefit. Dimensions of diversity include race, age, national
origin, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, intellectual and
physical ability, sexual orientation, faith and non-faith
perspectives, socio-economic class, political ideology, education,
primary language, family status, military experience, cognitive style,
and communication style. We are intentional in our aim to present
materials and activities that are respectful of diversity, based on
these dimensions and any other visible and invisible differences not
captured in this list. Indeed, in this class you will learn to
approach technology design from an empathetic, human-centered
perspective that directly examines and challenges bias and
inequality. Your suggestions for ensuring that the class lives up to
these values are encouraged and welcomed. In addition, if at any time
you experience or witness anything in this class that challenges
inclusion, is insensitive or othering, or reinforces biases or
stereotypes, please report those experiences (responses can be
anonymous).

## Health & Wellness
Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle
this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol,
getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you
achieve your goals and cope with stress.

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. There are
many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of
the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for
support sooner rather than later is almost always helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult
life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly
encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services
(CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at
[http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/](http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/). Consider
reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help
getting connected to the support that can help.

If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of
self-harm, call someone immediately, day or night:
